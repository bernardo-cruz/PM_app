# Hello There!

My Python journey started with this project. I was trying to learn how
to use the language and I decided to create a simple project to help me
with that. I was also trying to learn how to use GitHub, so I decided to
create a repository for this project. I hope you enjoy it!

# Background

My previous employer used used MS Excel for project controling :(

Each employee has a spreadsheet for each projects he/she could possibly
work on. Each project iself, has a spreadsheet with a lot of information
about the project, such as the project name, the project status, the
project start date, the project end date, the project budget, the
project cost. This spreadsheet is connected to all employees
spreadsheets, so a lot of connectionsâ€¦

Once the project owner want to know how much money he/she has spent on
the project, he/she has to open the project spreadsheet. The project
spreadsheet will open all employees spreadsheets and fetch the
information, it takes about 15min to fetch all data.

# The Project

I decided to use Flask, SQLlite and SQLAlchemy to create a simple web
application to help me with this problem. I created a simple database
with several tables, several projects and several employees. I also
created a simple web application to help me with the data input.
